String::Checker - An extensible string validation module (allowing commonly
used checks on strings to be called more concisely and consistently).

This is a very simple library for checking a string against a given
set of expectations.  It contains a number of pre-defined expectations
which can be used, and can also be extended to perform any arbitrary
match or modification on a string.

Why is this useful?  If you're only checking one string, it probably
isn't.  However, if you're checking a bunch of strings (say, for
example, CGI input parameters) against a set of expectations, this
comes in pretty handy.  As a matter of fact, the CGI::ArgChecker
module is a simple, CGI.pm aware wrapper for this library.

This module has only been tested under FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris, though
I can't think of any reason why it shouldn't work elsewhere.
